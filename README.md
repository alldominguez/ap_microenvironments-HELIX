This repository contains all the materials for the research article "Childhood exposure to outdoor air pollution in different microenvironments and cognitive and fine motor function in children from six European cohorts".

In this, we aim to explore the association between outdoor air pollution concentration, specifically nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 Î¼m (PM2.5), across various settings: home, school, and during commute. Our comprehensive approach simultaneously assesses these microenvironments and aim to identify whether specific microenvironments could have a pronounced impact on children's cognitive and fine motor function skills.
